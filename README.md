<h1>So this is my website for now<br/><a href="https://matthewherrera.com">matthewherrera.com</a></h1>

<h2>👨‍💻 What I did to launch this site: </h2>

- <b>HTML5</b>
- <b>CSS</b>
- <b>JavaScript for sweet animations</b>
- <b>Amazon S3 for bucket policy (storing my files)</b>
- <b>Cloudflare for SSL certificate. Cause having a portfolio website without encrpytion as a cybersecurity professional is pretty wack.</b>
